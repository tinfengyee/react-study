Create a complete TypeScript demo for React 19.2's {HookName} hook/API/component. Implement a practical example scenario: {ExampleScenario} (e.g., a form submission, data fetching, or UI update). Include the following elements:
- Proper TypeScript types for all inputs, outputs, and state.
- React-Hooks / React-Fragment 分别为 react 的内置模块
- A simple, modern UI using React components (e.g., with Tailwind CSS or inline styles for simplicity).
- Step-by-step comments explaining the hook's usage, benefits, and any gotchas.
- Integration with other React 19.2 features if relevant (e.g., combine with useOptimistic or Suspense).
- Best practices for performance and accessibility.
- Background explanation: Describe the historical context and motivation for introducing this hook/API/component in React 19.2 (e.g., what problems it addresses in previous versions).
- Problem solved: Explain the specific issues or pain points this feature resolves (e.g., async state management, optimistic updates).
- Usage examples: Provide 2-3 real-world use cases with brief descriptions.
- Simple source code demonstration: Include a minimal code snippet showing the core implementation principle, with comments highlighting key mechanics.
Ensure the demo is runnable in a Vite-based React app, follows React conventions, and avoids deprecated patterns. Provide the full code structure with file paths (e.g., src/Demo/{HookName}/index.tsx).
